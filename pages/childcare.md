# Childcare at MIDL 2022

MIDL 2022 will be offering childcare packages, together with UZH/ETHZ childcare, that can be booked by parents attending the event.Â 

Depending on the context and needs, a mobile care team will be offered for a multi-day program for individual children or groups.

The offer contains tailored childcare solutions with varieties of play and craft material. The care would be in close proximity to the conference venue to allow parents visiting the kids if wished and needed.
Small excursions like a visit of the zoo or a near playground are possible. For bigger groups a little dance event, a make-up party, or a visit of a clown may be organized.

Catering is included.
The childcare might be extended to the evening.
In case of further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us per mail via [childcare@2022.midl.io](mailto:childcare@2022.midl.io)
