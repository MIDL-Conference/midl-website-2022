## Hybrid registration for presenting authors

A **hybrid conference registration** will allow you to join the meeting either 'onsite' in Zurich, or virtually via the conference streaming platform, for example, if personal short-term changes prohibit you from travelling to Zurich.

All **presenting authors** need to register for a hybrid conference participation. If they know at the time of the registration that they will ***not*** be able to attend the meeting in Zurich ***onsite***, but only virtually, they can indicate this during the registration process. This will make them eligible for the ‘MIDL 2022 Hybrid Attendance Fellowship’, that will reduce their conference fees to the fees of a virtual participation.

All first authors will receive an individual registration link for the hybrid  participation. This Link can be used only once by any of the authors. This hybrid registration needs to take place until **14.05.2022**. Further authors can apply using the registration link below. 

The **MIDL 2022 Hybrid Attendance Fellowship** will reduce the conference fees of presenting authors who intend to join the conference via the conference streaming platform only. Authors can apply for it during the registration process, briefly explaining their need for a conference fee reduction, e.g., because of limited available funding at their home institution. The fellowships will be assigned by the MIDL Chairs based on the indicated reasons and the availability of funds (that will depend on the total number of attendees of the onsite conference). Assigned fellowships will be made available ***as a refund after the conference***. 

If an upfront payment of the higher fees for a hybrid attendance is not possible for individual authors, they can reach out to the conference chairs already before the conference at [2022@midl.io](mailto:2022@midl.io).

In case of a **cancellation of the onsite conference** event by the MIDL 2022 chairs, all hybrid conference registrations will be transformed into virtual conference registrations, and fees will be refunded accordingly.

Our aim is to keep the registration fees as low as possible for every attendee and have an enjoyable and productive onsite event in Zürich. 

## Standard Registration

The early-bird option ends on 14.05.2022, midnight.
For the student and junior postdoc discounts a proof is required and needs to be uploaded during the registration process (student ID, copy of PhD certificate with date)

Video recordings and photos are taken during the event and may be shared publicly during and after the event.

## Cancellation options:
Written requests for full reimbursement of costs will be accepted until 01.05.2022, for the reimbursement of 70% of costs until 14.05.2022. Please send an e-mail to [registration@2022.midl.io](mailto:registration@2022.midl.io)
These dates will not apply if the Swiss COVID restrictions prevent the organisation of the conference. In this case the conference will take place solely virtually and the difference to the onsite fee will be reimbursed.

## Visa application and Invitation Letters:
Please keep in mind that the Visa application procedure may take some time. Therefore, please register on time.
Invitation Letters for Visa applications can be requested during the registration process.

For authors of extended short paper abstracts planning to register conditionally upon acceptance of their extended abstract submission, to help with visa processing times, an invitation letter can be made available in advance through an early submission of a valid extended abstract. Validity of the submission will be judged by the conference organisers. Early extended abstract submissions may be updated until the standard submission deadline and will follow the same review / decision process and timeline as any other extended abstract. Early submissions must be performed through the normal abstract submission procedure using OpenReview, additionally, an email linking to the submission and asking for an invitation letter should be made to [2022@midl.io](mailto:2022@midl.io).
