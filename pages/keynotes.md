**Biography:** [Julia Schnabel](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/schnabel-julia) graduated in Informatics (equiv. MSc) from Technical University of Berlin, Germany, and was awarded the PhD in Computer Science from University College London, UK. After postdoc positions at University Medical Center Utrecht NL, King's College London and University College London, UK, she joined the University of Oxford, UK in 2007 as Associate Professor in Engineering Science (Medical Imaging), where she became Full Professor of Engineering Science by Recognition of Distinction in 2014. She subsequently joined King’s College London as a new Chair in Computational Imaging in 2015, and in 2021 also joined Technical University of Munich as Professor of Computational Imaging and AI in Medicine (TUM Liesel Beckmann Distinguished Professorship) and Helmholtz Center Munich as the Director of a new Institute of Machine Learning in Biomedical Imaging (Helmholtz Distinguished Professorship). Julia's research interests include machine/deep learning, nonlinear motion modelling, as well as multimodality and quantitative imaging, for cancer imaging, cardiac imaging, neuroimaging and perinatal imaging. She has been elected Fellow of IEEE (2021), ELLIS (2019), and MICCAI Society (2018). She is currently Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, on the Editorial Board of Medical Image Analysis, and an Executive/Founding Editor of www.melba-journal.org, a free open-access journal on machine learning in biomedical imaging. She currently serves as elected Technical Representative on IEEE EMBS AdCom, on the IEEE EMBS Technical Committee on Biomedical Imaging and Image Processing (BIIP), as Executive Secretary to the MICCAI Board of Directors, and as member of ELLIS Health and ELLIS Munich. Julia has been Program Chair of MICCAI 2018, General Chair of WBIR 2016 and IPMI 2021, and will be General Chair of WBIR 2022 (to be held in Munich), and of MICCAI 2024 (to be held for the first time in Africa: Marrakech, Morocco).
