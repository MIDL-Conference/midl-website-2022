# Doctoral Symposium
With the success of last years' MIDL satellite event, MIDL Doctoral Symposium, we are thrilled to announce that on the 9th of July 2022, the second MIDL Doctoral Symposium will take place! The event will be held as a separate hybrid satellite event conjuring MIDL 2022 in ZÃ¼rich and is specifically designed for young researchers to connect and learn from each other. 

The MIDL Doctoral Symposium 2022 will be a full-day event with a virtual morning lecture session and an afternoon session with in-person extracurricular activities. This way, students can develop their scientific knowledge and connect in person with fellow students. An informal get-together with dinner for the evening is planned to wrap up MIDL 2022. 

The selection process includes applications and candidates with high motivation who are in an early stage of their research career. The application will open in March and close in mid-May.

Further information and a detailed program to be posted in conjuring with the application opening.
