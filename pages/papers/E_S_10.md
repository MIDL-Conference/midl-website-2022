    <span class="abstract">
        In recent years, with the improvement of data collection and preprocessing, as well as the development of deep learning algorithms, there have been more opportunities for applying artificial intelligence to different areas, including neuroimaging. Various model learning pipelines are emerging to study the degree of cognitive impairment in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we explore knowledge transfer for the stability of the 3D computer vision models (CNN) for the classification of AD on ADNI data. To assess the model performance, and the quality of learned patterns and examine the ways of models overfitting we utilize conventional 3DCNN interpretation methods and swap tests. We imply that skull-stripping and knowledge transfer strategies can significantly impact the robustness and reproducibility of learned patterns, and suggest applying swap tests to ensure the model stability.
