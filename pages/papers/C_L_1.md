    <span class="abstract">
        Quantitative $T1rho$ imaging is a promising technique for assessment of chronic liver disease. The standard approach requires acquisition of multiple $T1rho$-weighted images of the liver to quantify $T1rho$ relaxation time. The quantification accuracy can be affected by respiratory motion if the subjects cannot hold the breath during the scan.  To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised mapping method by taking only one $T1rho$-weighted image to do the mapping. Our method takes into account of signal scale  variations in MR  scan when performing $T1rho$ quantification. Preliminary experimental results show that our method can achieve  better mapping performance than the traditional fitting method, particularly in free-breathing scenarios.
