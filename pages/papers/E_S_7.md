    <span class="abstract">
        In daily adaptive proton therapy, deformable image registration (DIR) can be used to propagate manually delineated contours from a reference CT to the daily CT for plan reoptimization. However, the ill-posedness of DIR implies uncertainty on the DIR hyperparameters, which results in uncertainty in the displacement field. In this work, a fast deep learning method is developed to predict the uncertainty associated with a DIR result without the need for Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. It is shown that this results in a significant time reduction compared to MC whilst leading to similar probabilistic contours.
