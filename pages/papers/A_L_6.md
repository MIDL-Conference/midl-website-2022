    <span class="abstract">
        Although  Automatic  Breast  Ultrasound  (ABUS)  has  become  an  important  tool  to  detect breast cancer, computer-aided diagnosis requires accurate segmentation of tumors on ABUS. In this paper, we propose the Region Aware Transformer Network (RAT-Net) for tumor  segmentation  on  ABUS  images.   RAT-Net  incorporates  region  prior  information of tumors into network design.  The specially designed Region Aware Self-Attention Block(RASAB) and Region Aware Transformer Block (RATB) fuse the tumor region information into multi-scale features to obtain accurate segmentation.  To the best of our knowledge,it is the first time that tumor region distributions are incorporated into network architectures for ABUS image segmentation.  Experimental results on a dataset containing 84,480 ABUS images taken from 256 subjects show that RAT-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
