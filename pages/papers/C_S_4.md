    <span class="abstract">
        Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have recently shown superior performance in image synthesis and have been extensively studied in various image processing tasks. In this work, we propose a 3D-DDPM for generating three-dimensional (3D) medical images. Different from previous studies, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt to investigate the DDPM to enable 3D medical image synthesis. We investigated the generation of high-resolution magnetic resonance images (MRI) of brain tumors. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on a semi-public dataset, with both quantitative and qualitative tests showing promising results.
