    <span class="abstract">
        Digital pathology has demonstrated its impact in improving diagnostics and prognostics in the field of pathology, through the utilization of deep learning algorithms. However, equipment from different scanner vendors used for digitizing the glass slides impose challenges for researchers due to non-interoperability between their proprietary formats. We have previously published OpenPhi (Open PatHology Interface), a Python Application Programming Interface providing seamless access to the iSyntax format of the Philips Ultra Fast Scanner, and in this short paper, we summarise its key features.
