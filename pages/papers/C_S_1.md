        Academic papers and challenges focus mostly on metrics that measure how well a model's output p(y) approximates labels y. However, a high performance based on these metrics is not a sufficient condition for a practically useful model. Looking into the complexity of a model both in terms of hardware and software can shed more light on the practical merit. This short paper discusses several measures for medical AI system that do not focus solely on labels and predictions. We encourage the research community to consider these metrics more often.
