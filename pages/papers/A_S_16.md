    <span class="abstract">
        Fluorescence light sheet microscopy (LSM) of tissue cleared samples enables holistic 3D imaging of the human brain and the full murine body. While this novel imaging method creates high resolution scans and has led to an abundance of high-profile publications in the last 5 years, analysing them is not trivial and comes with complex obstacles. In this paper we present a review and discussion of our groups previous works to present best practices on both animal and human scans and guidelines to overcome these obstacles
