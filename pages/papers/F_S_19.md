    <span class="abstract">
        Doppler echocardiography is commonly used for functional assessment of heart valves such as mitral valve. Currently, the measurements are made manually which is a laborious and subjective process. We have demonstrated the feasibility of using neural networks to fully automate the process of mitral valve inflow measurements. Experiments show that the automated system yields comparable performance to the experts.
