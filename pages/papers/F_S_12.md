    <span class="abstract">
        In this paper, we present a fully automated system for tumor-stroma ratio scoring in line with current recommendations for pathologists, based on tumor and tumor-adjacent stroma tissue detection. In order to evaluate the scoring system, we perform survival analysis on 221 whole slide images from colorectal cancer patients. We find that the whole slide-level and region of interest-level tumor-stroma ratio are statistically significant predictors of overall survival.
