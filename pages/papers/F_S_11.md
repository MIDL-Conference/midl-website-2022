    <span class="abstract">
        Grading of vertebral compression fractures most commonly relies on a semi-quantitative grading scale that defines fractures as height loss of the vertebral body. This paper presents an alternative approach that instead considers the three-dimensional shape of the vertebral body and expresses the abnormality of the shape on a scale from 0 to 100. The abnormality is expressed relative to the expected healthy shape, which is predicted by a deep generative model that is provided with contextual information, namely shape and orientation of surrounding vertebrae.
