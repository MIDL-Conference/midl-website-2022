    <span class="abstract">
        Tissue Doppler Imaging is an essential echocardiographic technique for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial blood velocity. Interpretation by trained experts is time-consuming and disruptive to workflow. This study presents an automated deep learning model, trained and tested on Doppler strips of arbitrary length, capable of rapid beat detection and Cartesian coordinate localisation of peak velocities with accuracy indistinguishable from human experts, but with greater speed.
