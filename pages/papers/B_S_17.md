    <span class="abstract">
        This paper proposes an extension to the Dual Branch Prior-Net for sparse view interventional CBCT reconstruction incorporating a high quality planning scan. An additional head learns to segment interventional instruments and thus guides the reconstruction task. The prior scans are misaligned by up to +-5deg in-plane during training. Experiments show that the proposed model, Dual Branch Prior-SegNet, significantly outperforms any other evaluated model by >2.8dB PSNR. It also stays robust wrt. rotations of up to +-5.5deg.
