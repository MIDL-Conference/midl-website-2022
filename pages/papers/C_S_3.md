    <span class="abstract">
        Corneal confocal microscopy is used in both ophthalmology and neurology to identify and monitor the immunological and neural effects of ocular and systemic diseases. However, its use in research and clinical settings is limited by the lack of reliable, time-efficient methods to process acquired data. A typical imaging session yields a stack of images varying in quality and field of view that require careful filtering prior to further analysis. Here, we present a framework for automated quality assessment and selection of distinct human corneal confocal microscopy images suitable for downstream analysis.
