    <span class="abstract">
        This paper presents ClinicaDL, a deep learning software for neuroimaging processing. Its aim is to provide a concrete solution to methodological flaws often found in our field (the difficult use of neuroimaging data sets, data leakage and insufficient reproducibility), but also to raise awareness and discuss these issues with our community. The corresponding journal paper was recently accepted in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine.
