    <span class="abstract">
        Assessing prostate biopsies is crucial for the clinical management of patients with suspected prostate cancer, but is associated with complications such as inter-observer variability. The PANDA challenge aimed at mitigating these issues through development and rigorous validation of image analysis algorithms for the task. In this short paper, we summarize the key insights gained from PANDA from the viewpoints of algorithm development and challenge organisation.
