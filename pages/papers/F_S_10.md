    <span class="abstract">
        Proton therapy is a promising option for cancer treatment, even though its radiobiological properties are not yet fully considered in clinical practice. In this context, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons is the most important quantity, which is strongly related to their linear energy transfer (LET). LET distributions can be provided by commercial treatment-planning systems based on Monte Carlo simulations. However, such systems require a considerable amount of computational resources, are not yet available in every proton-therapy centre and may not be applicable to assess retrospective patient data. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for inferring LET distributions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on proton therapy radiation dose distributions and treatment-planning computed tomography (CT). We further evaluate established models for estimating treatment-related side effects after proton therapy of brain tumours and observe good agreement between CNN and MC based outputs.
