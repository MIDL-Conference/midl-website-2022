    <span class="abstract">
        The main goal of this paper is to compare the energy efficiency of quantized neural networks to perform medical image analysis on different processors and neural network architectures. Deep neural networks have demonstrated outstanding performance in medical image analysis but require high computation and power usage. In our work, we review the power usage and temperature of processors when running Resnet and Unet architectures to perform image classification and segmentation respectively. We compare Edge TPU, Jetson Nano, Apple M1, Nvidia Quadro P6000 and Nvidia A6000 to infer using full-precision FP32 and quantized INT8 models. The results will be useful for designers and implementers of medical imaging AI on hand-held or edge computing devices.
