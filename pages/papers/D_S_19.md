    <span class="abstract">
        Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a premalignant histopathological diagnosis given to lesions of the oral cavity, characterised by changes to the nuclear morphometry and the epithelial layers. In this work, we have finetuned HoVer-Net+ for the simultaneous segmentation of nuclei and the epithelial layers in heamatoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs). We then employed a multi-scale attention-based multiple instance learning architecture for the prediction of OED status, grade, recurrence and malignant transformation. The impressive results have demonstrated the potential of such methods.
