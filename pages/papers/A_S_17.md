    <span class="abstract">
        We propose improvements to an automated method for scoliosis measurement. Our main novelty is the use of a spline to better model the curve of the spine, and we employ pseudo- labelling to re-train the segmentation step to mitigate the domain gap when adapting to a new dataset. We obtain promising results with a good fit of our smoothed curve to approximate the spinal midpoints in severe scoliosis cases, and obtain good agreement against human ground-truth. This work is relevant for improving the severity grading of scoliosis and potentially aiding in the treatment management of scoliosis.
