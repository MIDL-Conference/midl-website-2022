    <span class="abstract">
        Reconstructing shapes of three-dimensional (3D) objects from two-dimensional (2D) images is a challenging spatial reasoning task for both our brain and computer vision algorithms.  We focus on solving this inverse problem with a novel deep learning SHApe PRediction autoencoder (SHAPR), and showcase its potential on 2D confocal microsopy images of single cells and nuclei.  Our findings indicate that SHAPR reconstructs 3D shapes of red blood cells from 2D images more accurately than na√Øve stereological models and significantly increases the feature-based classification of red blood cell types.  Applying  it to 2D images of spheroidal aggregates of densely grown human induced pluripotent stem cells, we observe that SHAPR learns fundamental shape properties of cell nuclei and allows for prediction-based 3D morphometry.  SHAPR can help to optimize and up-scale image-based high-throughput applications by reducing imaging time and data storage.
