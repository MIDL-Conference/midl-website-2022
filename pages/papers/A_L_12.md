    <span class="abstract">
        Radiological examination of chest CT is an effective method for screening COVID-19 cases. In this work, we overcome three challenges in the automation of this process: (i) the limited number of supervised positive cases, (ii) the lack of region-based supervision, and (iii) variability across acquisition sites. These challenges are met by incorporating a recent augmentation solution called SnapMix and a new patch embedding technique, and by performing a test-time stability analysis. The three techniques are complementary and are all based on utilizing the heatmaps produced by the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) explainability method. Compared to the current state of the art, we obtain an increase of five percent in the F1 score on a site with a relatively high number of cases and a gap twice as large for a site with much fewer training images.
