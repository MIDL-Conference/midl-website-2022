    <span class="abstract">
        White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are brain white matter lesions commonly found in the elderly. Due to its association with cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, quantifying WMH volume is critical for many neurological applications. Previous segmentation approaches using 2D U-Net potentially omit the learning of 3D spatial contextual information. This paper proposes a deeply supervised 3D U-Net-like network with transfer learning to perform WMH segmentation in fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance images (MRI). We leveraged a pretrained network constructed by predicting brain age from structural MRIs. The proposed method achieved a Dice score of 82.3 on the MICCAI WMH Challenge training dataset and 75.3 on another independent testing dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.
