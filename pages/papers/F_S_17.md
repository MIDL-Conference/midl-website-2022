    <span class="abstract">
        Sarcopenia refers to a skeletal muscle disorder that results in gradual and widespread muscle loss. Single-slice sarcopenia quantification is done with the localization of a vertebra first, followed by muscle segmentation.  In this paper, we present a fully automated sarcopenia assessment pipeline for CT scans, relying on powerful deep learning based techniques. Our framework consists of two steps, one that solves the detection of the appropriate CT slice using reinforcement learning and one that addresses the segmentation of the abdominal muscle mass together with the total quantification of its area.  Our pipeline has been evaluated on 100 patients, including different CT scan protocols, and reports an overall quantification performance smaller than the interobserver, indicating its potential for clinical practice.
