    <span class="abstract">
        Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer amongst women. Its regular screening, often based on mammograms, significantly reduces the mortality. Deep learning has shown good performances in coping with screening-generated imaging data, however there are still open questions related to the imbalance, noisiness, and heterogeneity of the data. We propose to address these challenges with Multi-Task Learning, combining tasks such as classification, regression, segmentation, and reconstruction. Our approach allows to obtain consistent performances of AUC $\approx 0.80$ across different vendors (including those unknown during training) on the primary breast cancer classification task, while fulfilling well secondary tasks including an $F_1$ score of $0.96$ on 4-class vendor classification, and $F_1$ score of 0.64 on 4-class density classification.
