    <span class="abstract">
        Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have had great success for medical imaging segmentation. Many methods attained nearly perfect Dice scores, sometimes within inter-expert variability. However, CNNs require large amounts of labeled data and are not immune to producing anatomically implausible results, especially when applied to ultrasound images.  In this paper, we propose a method that tackles both of these problems simultaneously.  Our method optimizes anatomical segmentation metrics on both labeled and unlabeled data using a training scheme analogous to adversarial training.  Our method allows the optimization of several hand-made non-differentiable metrics for any segmentation model and drastically reduces the number of anatomical errors.
