    <span class="abstract">
        One of the main challenges in laparoscopic procedures is handling intraoperative bleeding. We propose video-based Computer-aided Laparoscopic Bleeding Management (CALBM) for early detection and management of intraoperative bleeding. Our system performs the online video-based segmentation of bleeding sources and displays them to the surgeon. It hinges on an improved space-time memory network, which we train from real and semi-synthetic data, using adversarial domain adaptation. Our system improves the IoU and F-Score from 69.97% to 73.40% and 50.23% to 58.09% in comparison to the baseline space-time memory network. It is far better than the prior CALBM systems based on still images, which we reimplemented with DeepLabV3+, reaching an  IoU and F-Score of 65.86% and 43.19%. The improvement is also supported by user evaluation.
