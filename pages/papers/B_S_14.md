    <span class="abstract">
        Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is heterogeneous due to the differences in device manufacturers, scanning protocols, and inter-subject variability. Although preprocessing pipeline standardizes image appearance, its influence on the quality of image segmentation on deep neural networks (DNN) has never been rigorously studied. Here we report a comprehensive study of multimodal MRI brain cancer image segmentation on TCIA-GBM open-source dataset. Our results that the most popular standardization steps add no value to artificial neural network performance; moreover, preprocessing can hamper model performance. We show that the only essential transformation for accurate analysis is the unification of voxel spacing across the dataset.
