    <span class="abstract">
        Hyperpolarized (HP) gas MRI enables quantification of regional lung ventilation via clinical biomarkers such as the ventilation defect percentage (VDP). VDP is computed from segmentations derived from spatially co-registered functional HP gas MRI and structural proton ($^1$H)-MRI; although these scans are acquired at similar inflation levels, misalignments are frequent, requiring a lung cavity estimation (LCE). Here, we propose a multi-channel deep learning method for generating LCEs using HP gas and $^1$H-MRI. We compare the performance of the proposed method to single-channel alternatives.
