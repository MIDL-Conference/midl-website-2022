        abstract='Assessment of the left ventricle segmentation in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of crucial importance for cardiac disease diagnosis. However, conventional manual segmentation is a tedious task that requires excessive human effort, which makes automated segmentation highly desirable in practice to facilitate the process of clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based framework for left ventricle contouring, which mimics how a cardiologist outlines the left ventricle along a specific trajectory in a cardiac image. Following the algorithm of proximal policy optimization (PPO), we train a policy network, which makes a stochastic decision on the agent's movement according to its local observation such that the generated trajectory matches the true contour of the left ventricle as much as possible. Moreover, we design a deep learning model with a customized loss function to generate the agent's landing spot (or coordinate of its initial position on a cardiac image). The experiment results show that the coordinate of the generated landing spot is sufficiently close to the true contour and the proposed reinforcement-learning-based approach outperforms the existing U-net model even with limited training set.')

        abstract='Reconstructing anatomical shapes from sparse or partial measurements relies on prior knowledge of shape variations that occur within a given population. Such shape priors are learned from example shapes, obtained by segmenting volumetric medical images. For existing models, the resolution of a learned shape prior is limited to the resolution of the training data. However, in clinical practice, volumetric images are often acquired with highly anisotropic voxel sizes, e.g. to reduce image acquisition time in MRI or radiation exposure in CT imaging. The missing shape information between the slices prohibits existing methods to learn a high-resolution shape prior. We introduce a method for high-resolution shape reconstruction from sparse measurements without relying on high-resolution ground truth for training. Our method is based on neural implicit shape representations and learns a continuous shape prior only from highly anisotropic segmentations. Furthermore, it is able to learn from shapes with a varying field of view and can reconstruct from various sparse input configurations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on two anatomical structures: vertebra and distal femur, and successfully reconstruct high-resolution shapes from sparse segmentations, using as few as three orthogonal slices.')
