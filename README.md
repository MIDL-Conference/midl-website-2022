# MIDL 2022 (ZÃ¼rich) website

This repository contains the source code of the 2022.midl.io website.

* Pages are files in `pages/` and can either be MarkDown (`.md`) or HTML (`.html`) files
* Global settings, such as the navigation bar, are in `website.yaml`

The website is automatically rebuilt after every commit to the master branch.
